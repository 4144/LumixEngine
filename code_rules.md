General Rules
--------------------------------------------

* Quality is the most important feature.
* Write for readers - code is read and debugged many more times it is changed.
* Consistency - look at the way things are already done - formatting, filenames, structure, ...
* Keep it simple, stupid.
* Templates, C++11, ... use whatever you think is reasonable if it works on all supported platforms.
* Asserts should not be triggered by data and data can not cause crashes. 
* Any block of code should not be longer than one page (about 40 lines), except namespaces and classes.
