title:      An electronic oscillator and The Arduino Starter Kit
date:       2015-4-27 20:00:00
summary:    I bought The Arduino Starter Kit to learn something new and eventually build a spaceship :). I've want to understand fundamental principles behind electronic circuits so I had decided to build an electronic oscillator from components available in The Arduino Starter Kit.

I won't go into detail about [electronic oscillators](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_oscillator) since it can be easily found on the web. However I've not found any article for a noob like me on how to build an electronic oscillator from [components contained in The Arduino Starter Kit](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoStarterKit). If you search for an image of electronic oscillator on Google, you can find many schematics, but most of them contains parts not contained in the kit.

I do not have a schema for this, however I found [a close one](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6Z1sa.gif). Some connections are hard to see in the photos, however the circuit is symmetrical, so that might help.
